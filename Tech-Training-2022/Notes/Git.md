# Git and Github

---

**Git** is a tool, **GitHub** is a service provider

## Motivation behind Git

- Saving files over and over with different suffixes to have different versions
- Emailing files back and forth in order to collaborate, or deploy.

## What is a Version Control System?

- A system that keeps records of changes
- Allows for collaborative development
- Allows you to know who made changes and what was changed
- Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state

- All changes done to a repository (Folder) are saved by Git
- Has it's own file structure under the how-to-get-to-continuous-deployment
